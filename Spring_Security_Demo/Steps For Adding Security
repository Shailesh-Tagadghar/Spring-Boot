1. Create new spring project
2. Add dependencies:
   Spring web
   Security
   Mysql Driver
   Rest Repository
   JPA
   Validation -- this dependency we will add DTO (Data Trasfer Object) while this process -- using this valiadation -- we can define schema of table

3. Create User class and UserRepository interface
4. Define code into this
5. Add some records using POSTMAN
6. Check all user is visible in postman using get method
7. Now add Security Dependency into project
8. Restart Project
9. We will get Security key ---- (ca8fdb43-f601-4514-9fe9-7d53786f7524)  like this
   >>>>To store password ---- use this code into resource --- application.properties file
     spring.security.user.name=shailesh
     spring.security.user.password=shailesh1

10. go to postman --- authorazition --- type -- basic auth -- define username and password
11. then check for records
12. after that we will create SecurityConf.java file for writing configuration code for accessing the Url's (line public and private and role based as well)
13. then we will create In model folder - UserDTO.java file -- to define jakarta.validation.constraints.Email like this -- in this file we will define only validation annotation @NotNull @Pattern
14. we have to do some changes in User.java file as well -- in this file we have define only jakarta.persistence.Column like this -- @Entity @Id
15. and we have do some changes in UserRepository.java file -- 
   @RestResource(exported = false)
	public User save(User user);
   we have to add this code into this file.... to save this data
