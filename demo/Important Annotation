#Important Annotations : 
1.	@Component  :
   - Class level annotation
   - Bean will created by spring for this class 
  Child Annotations of @Component :
1.	@Controller
2.	@RestController
   @RestController is combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody annotation.
3.	@Service
4.	@Repository


2. @Autowired : field injection
   - It will use in Dependency Injection (DI)
   -# Dependency -  depending on something 
         Eg :  Car is depend on its engine if there is no engine car won’t work.
   -# Injection :- Injecting something into class 
         Eg : Serine injects medicine into our body.

# Dependency Injection (DI).-Way to implement the IOC

3.	@Bean and @Configuration
Bean is required for In build classes
  -method level annotation
  - used on top of the methods which returns  the bean of some inbuild classes

Whenever we use @Bean, we need to use @Configuration (class level annotation)

@Configuration – THIS indicates to spring framework that there are some methods will returns the bean.

Spring will execute all @Bean methods from @Configuration class and keeps the beans ready for injection

4.	@ComponentScan
5.	@SpringBootApplication
